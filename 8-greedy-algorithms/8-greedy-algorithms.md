8.1:
Greedy:Pick the biggest box that will fit in the remaining space at each stage. Stop when there is no more space.

Not optimal, you may only have space for one box.

8.2:
Greedy: Pick the highest priority item that will fit into the remaining time at each stage. Stop when there is no more time.

Not optimal because you may only have time for one item.

8.3:
Quicksort: not greedy, picking a pivot is not picking the locally optimal solution

8.4:
BFS: not greedy, at each stage the node's children are added to the queue in any order

8.5:
Djikstra: greedy, at each stage pick the lowest cost / closest node

8.6:
Yes, similar to the traveling salesman problem.

8.7:
Yes, set-covering problem.

8.8:
